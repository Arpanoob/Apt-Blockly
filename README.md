folder contains:

scripts/
        main.js - The main logic for the app. In the starter project it has all the code needed to navigate and switch between views in the basic app.
        
        music_maker.js - A small library to play sounds. We will use it to actually play sounds in the browser.
        
        sounds/ - Sound files for various notes
        
        styles/ - The app's CSS
        
        index.html - The app's index page.

Play Mode
By default, the app launches in "Play Mode". In this mode, you can see 9 buttons. None of them can do anything yet. The idea is to let the user define custom behaviors for each button, using Blockly.

Edit mode
By tapping the EDIT button, you can switch to edit mode. In this mode, tapping a button will display an editor, which is where you can program how sounds should play for that button.

set block=> how many times to repeate the song
play block=> which song should be played 

play mode by tapping SAVE and then DONE buttons.

then click on button which you edited
in playmode
